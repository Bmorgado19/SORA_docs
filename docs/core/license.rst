Using and Citing SORA
=====================

Terms of Use
------------


From the collaboration Rio/Granada/Paris with objects that are up to discussion by 
the collaboration (TNOs, Centaurs, ...). In this case, the SORA team may have the 
possibility to decide if any of its PIs should be co-author of the publication. 
The SORA team will commit to:

* Teach the functionalities of the SORA package in a hands-on session or individually;
* Run SORA if necessary;
* Fix any bug with urgency;
* Implement new requested features with high priority;

Anyone outside the collaboration or by someone from the collaboration but with objects 
that are not up to discussion by the collaboration (e.g. Main-Belt Asteroids, NEAs). 
In this case, the SORA team will not demand the possibility to become a co-author. 
As a drawback, the SORA team will not consider urgent any bug reported (unless it is 
a critical bug) in these cases nor be available to teach. If the user wants more priority 
or attention by the team a discussion will be made in advance to discuss the addition of 
a specific co-author from the SORA team.

If you use SORA (or part of SORA) in a scientific publication, we would appreciate that you 
add at your acknowledgement the following statement: 

::

    “This research made use of SORA, a python package for stellar occultations reduction and
    analysis, developed with the support of ERC Lucky Star and LIneA/Brazil.”
