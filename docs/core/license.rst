Using and Citing SORA
=====================

Terms of Use
------------


SORA is free software and we kindly ask users that make use of it (or part of it), especially in 
projects, if that results in scientific publications, to include the following acknowledgment 
statement:

::

    “This research made use of SORA, a python package for stellar occultations reduction and 
    analysis, developed with the support of ERC Lucky Star and LIneA/Brazil.”


Also, for a scientific publication, please be attentive the following terms of use for 
co-authorship:

1. If you *participate in the collaboration Rio/Granada/Paris* and use SORA for the analysis of 
   *objects within the collaboration* (e.g. TNOs, Centaurs, giant planets Trojans, among others), 
   the SORA team may have the possibility to decide if any of its PIs should be co-author of the 
   publication. In this case, the SORA team will commit to:
   
   * Teach the functionalities of the SORA package in a hands-on session or individually;
   * Run SORA, if necessary;
   * Fix any bug - in SORA code - with urgency;
   * Implement new requested features with high priority.

2. If you *participate in the collaboration Rio/Granada/Paris* and use SORA for the analysis of 
   *objects outside the collaboration* (e.g. Main-Belt Asteroids, NEAs, among others), the SORA 
   team will not demand the possibility to become a co-author, but it should be included in the 
   acknowledgement sentence (see below) in the publication. 

3. If you are *NOT from the Rio/Granada/Paris collaboration* and use SORA for the analysis of *any 
   object* the SORA team will not demand the possibility to become a co-author, but it should be 
   included in the acknowledgement sentence (see below) in the publication.


As a drawback for itens 2 and 3, the SORA team will NOT commit to:
   * Teach the functionalities of the SORA package in a hands-on session or individually;
   * Run SORA;
   * Fix any bug - in SORA code - with urgency, unless it is a critical bug;
   * Implement new requested features with high priority;


In the event of granting priority or special attention to the user by the SORA team, further discussions will be made to address the addition of a specific co-author (or co-authors) from the team in the publication.
